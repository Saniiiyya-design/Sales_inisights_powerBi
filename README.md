💡 Key Business Insights

Revenue peaked during earlier periods and showed a gradual decline towards 2020, indicating changing demand patterns.

A small group of top customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue, highlighting customer dependency risk.

Electrical-focused customers consistently generate the highest revenue and sales volume.

Sales quantity does not always directly correlate with revenue, suggesting differences in pricing or product mix.

Monthly revenue trends show noticeable volatility, indicating seasonal demand behavior.
